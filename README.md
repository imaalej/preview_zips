# preview_zips
v1.0.2_prerelease
Utility tool to preview images in every zip in a folder, individual zip, or every subdirectory of a folder.
I'm currently expanding this to preview different supported media types.

### v1.0.2 In-Progress Changelog
**Added**

- 

**Changed**

- Importing an uncompressed directory now extracts every item from all subdirectories as , not just the selected folder.
- Warning and progress dialogues for importing a directory.


**Fixed**

-  ~~Columns used to be as wide as the widest item, adding a lot of empty white space, but not anymore...although if your window isn't sized appropriately it will uhh...you'll see, I'll have to figure that out~~
-  columns get appropriately sized based on the width of your client :o
